# Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a reproducible record of all analyses and figures in the main article. The main article is focused on the effect of response diversity on community stability in fluctuating environments. We are going to look at the effect of response diversity, richness, temperature and nutrients on community temporal stability. Specifically, we are going to look at the effect of fundamental balance (our measurement of stability) on temporal stability. Then, as response diversity is thought to stabilize temporal stability of aggregate community properties via asynchrony, we are going to look at the relationship between response diversity and asynchrony. 
Finally, as multiple evidence suggests that compensatory dynamics and temporal stability are determine by species interactions, we are going to analyse the effect of species interactions on stability to understand if they are more important than response diversity in driving temporal stability of community biomass.

This document is produced by an Rmarkdown file that includes code to reproduce from data all results presented in the main article.

# Main Results 

We now look at the main results of the experiment. We are going to look first at the effect of richness, temperature and nutrients on community temporal stability. Then, we are going to look at the reltionship between divergence (original response diversity metric) and temporal stability. Finally, we are going to look at the relationship between response diversity and temporal stability.

In the whole analysis, we calculated the temporal stability of total community biomass as the inverse of the coefficient of variation (ICV) (i.e. $\frac{\sigma}{\mu}$).

We can see that richness does not have a clear effect on community temporal stability, while stability was higher at lower temperature, and nutrients increased community temporal stability.

### Effect of Divergence

We look at the relationship between divergence (our original response diversity metric) and stability

```{r divergence_CV, results='hide', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.height=10, fig.width=16}

plot_CV_divergence<-complete_aggr%>%ggplot(aes(x=divergence,y=log10(1/CV),color=richness))+

  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = log10(c(0.1,0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2)),
    labels = c("0.1","0.2"," 0.4", "0.8", "1.6", "3.2")
  ) +
    theme(
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 25),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 25),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 14),                      # Axis text size             # Facet label text size
    legend.title = element_text(size = 20),                   # Legend title size
    legend.text = element_text(size = 20),                     # Legend text size
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "grey80", color = NA),  
    strip.text = element_text(size = 22)) +
  facet_wrap(~richness, labeller = as_labeller(function(x) paste0("richness = ", x)))+
  ylab("Temporal stability\nlog(mean/s.d.)")+
  xlab("divergence")

```
**Figure 3**: Relationship between Divergence and temporal stability of total community biomass.



Divergence is positively related to temporal stability, suggesting that response diversity promotes stability. However, the relationship between divergence and stability becomes weaker as richness increases. This is why, after running the experiment, we developed another metric to measure response diversity, which we called balance, and that is presented in the main text of the publication. 
Balance has several desirable features that makes it a more suitable metric than divergence: Independence of richness, higher predictive power, and accounts for the responses of all species in the community (as opposed to divergence that accounts for only the 2 most "responding" species).

Here, we provide extensive evidence of why balance is a better metric to measure response diversity than divergence, and thus justifying focusing the analysis around balance.

# Comparing Divergence and Balance

We first compare how well divergence and balance predict stability (predictive power). 

```{r results='hide', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(broom)
library(kableExtra)

complete_aggr <- complete_aggr %>% mutate(stability = 1/CV) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(balance_f = abs_sum_slope,
                balance_r = avg_w_sumslopes)



# summary(lm_full)
# anova(lm_full)
```

## Balance


Model assumptions
```{r model_check1, fig.align="center", fig.height=9, fig.width=12, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# 

mod1 <- lm(data=complete_aggr,log10(stability)~log10(balance_f))
check_model(mod1)

```
```{r include = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
performance(mod1)
```


## Divergence
```{r model_check2, fig.align="center", fig.height=9, fig.width=12}
mod2 <- lm(data=complete_aggr,log10(stability)~(divergence))
check_model(mod2)

```

```{r include = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
performance(mod2)

```


Balance explains more of the variance in stability than divergence.


Moreover, from **Figure 3**, it looks like divergence declines in performance as richness increases. Let's test this analytically.
To do than we build a linear model having stability as response variable and either log10(balance) or divergence as predictor for each richness level. We then extract the R squared of the models and their *standardised* estimates. (standardised estimates were calculated centering divergence and balance using the function scale()).

```{r include = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# getting model estimates for each richness level
lm_divergence_richness_E <- complete_aggr %>%
  nest(data = -richness) %>%
  mutate(
    model = map(data, ~ lm(log10(stability) ~ scale(divergence), data = .x)),
    results = map(model, broom::tidy)
  ) %>%
  unnest(results) %>% dplyr::filter(term=="scale(divergence)") 


# getting model R squared for each richness level

lm_divergence_richness_R <- complete_aggr %>%
  nest(data = -richness) %>%
  mutate(
    model = map(data, ~ lm(log10(stability) ~ scale(divergence), data = .x)),
    results = map(model, broom::glance)
  ) %>%
  unnest(results) 

lm_divergence_richness_R
```


```{r include = TRUE, echo=TRUE}

# getting model estimatesf or each richness level
lm_balance_richness_E <- complete_aggr %>%
  nest(data = -richness) %>%
  mutate(
    model = map(data, ~ lm(log10(stability) ~ scale(log10(balance_f)), data = .x)),
    results = map(model, broom::tidy)
  ) %>%
  unnest(results) %>% dplyr::filter(term=="scale(log10(balance_f))") 



# getting model R squared for each richness level
lm_balance_richness_R <- complete_aggr %>%
  nest(data = -richness) %>%
  mutate(
    model = map(data, ~ lm(log10(stability) ~ scale(log10(balance_f)), data = .x)),
    results = map(model, broom::glance)
  ) %>%
  unnest(results) 

lm_balance_richness_R
```


```{r R_squared, fig.align="center", fig.height=9, fig.width=12}
# plot how the r squared changes with richness for divergence and balance with legend and lines
a <- ggplot(data = lm_divergence_richness_R, aes(x = richness, y = r.squared, color = "Divergence")) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1)) +
  geom_point(data = lm_balance_richness_R, aes(x = richness, y = r.squared, color = "Balance")) +
  geom_line(data = lm_balance_richness_R, aes(x = richness, y = r.squared, color = "Balance", group = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Richness", y = "R squared", color = "Model") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Divergence" = "blue", "Balance" = "red"))+ labs(tag = "(a)")


# plot how the estinmates changes with richness for divergence and balance with legend and lines
b <- ggplot(data = lm_divergence_richness_E, aes(x = richness, y = estimate, color = "Divergence")) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1)) +
  geom_point(data = lm_balance_richness_E, aes(x = richness, y = abs(estimate), color = "Balance")) +
  geom_line(data = lm_balance_richness_E, aes(x = richness, y = abs(estimate), color = "Balance", group = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Richness", y = "Estimate", color = "Model") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Divergence" = "blue", "Balance" = "red")) + labs(tag = "(b)")

a + b


```
**Figure 4**: Performance comparison of divergence vs balance. In (a), the R squared of linear models for divergence and balance are shown for each richness level. In (b), the estimates of the linear models for divergence and balance are shonw for each richness level.



We can see that the R squared of divergence as predictor of stability becomes smaller as richness increases, while the R squared of balance as predictor of stability does not (actually increases slightly). 


Now we build a linear model were stability is modeled as a function of balance and divergence. 
Then, we compared the variance explained by the full model compared to a model containing either only balance or only divergence.

```{r model_check3, fig.align="center", fig.height=9, fig.width=12, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
lm_div_balance <- lm(data=complete_aggr,log10(stability)~log10(balance_f)+divergence)
check_model(lm_div_balance)
```

```{r include = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
performance(lm_div_balance)
```
model with only divergence
```{r model_check4, fig.align="center", fig.height=9, fig.width=12, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
lm_div <- lm(data=complete_aggr,log10(stability)~divergence)
check_model(lm_div)
```


```{r include = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
performance(lm_div)
```

model with only balance
```{r model_check5, fig.align="center", fig.height=9, fig.width=12, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
lm_balance <- lm(data=complete_aggr,log10(stability)~log10(balance_f))
check_model(lm_balance)
```

```{r include = TRUE}
performance(lm_balance)
```


```{r include = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
anova(lm_div_balance,  lm_balance)
```


```{r include = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
anova(lm_div_balance,  lm_div)
```

Balance explains more of the variance in stability than divergence, and there is virtually no difference between a model containing only balance and the full model.
Richness had to transformed to numeric and to be centered to avoid collinearity with divergence

```{r model_check6, fig.align="center", fig.height=9, fig.width=12, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}


lm_rich_div <- lm(data=complete_aggr,log10(stability)~divergence*scale(as.numeric(richness)))
check_model(lm_rich_div)
```

```{r include = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
anova(lm_rich_div)
```


Divergence significantly interact with richness, suggesting that the relationship between divergence and stability changes with richness. 
While an ideal metric of response diversity should be independent of richness.


We repeat the same model using balance instead of divergence.
```{r model_check7, fig.align="center", fig.height=9, fig.width=12, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
lm_rich_balance <- lm(data=complete_aggr,log10(stability)~log10(balance_f)*scale(as.numeric(richness)))
check_model(lm_rich_balance)
```

```{r include = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
anova(lm_rich_balance)

Balance does not significantly interact with richness, suggesting that the relationship between balance and stability is stable across richness levels.

Finally, we assess variable importance using the relative importance of predictors in the full model.
We use the package vip (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vip/vignettes/vip.html) to calculate the relative importance of predictors in the full model.
The function vip::vip for multiple linear regression, or linear models (LMs), uses the absolute value of the -statistic  as a measure of VI.
Motivation for the use of the associated 𝑡-statistic is given in Bring (1994) [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1994.10476059].

**Figure 5**: Variable importance in the model including both balance and divergence as predictors of stability.


We believe that the extensive evidence here provided justifies focusing the analysis around balance, and not divergence, as a metric of response diversity.
We will thus only look at balance for the rest of the analysis. 



# Effect RD

We are now going to look at how response diversity (balance) affected temporal stability of total community biomass. We are going to look at the relationship between fundamental balance (so based only on species response surfaces measured in monoculture), an realised balance (measured accounting for species contribution to balance).

This is fundamentally testing our most important hypothesis.

```

We can see that balance is always negatively related to temporal stability, which means that response diversity promotes stability across richness levels. Interestingly, we see that there is little difference between fundamental and realised balance. Yet, as the richness increases, the relationship between realised balance and stability becomes steeper compared to fundamental balance. 


We can see that the positive relationship between temporal stability and response diversity measured as divergence holds, but it becomes shallower as richness increases. We could speculated that this due to divergence considering only the responses of the 2 most "responding" species. Thus, when species richness increases, disregarding the responses of the other species in the community except the 2 responding the most makes the relationship between response diversity and stability weaker. 


# Linear models


## Model: Fundamental balance

First we analyze the effect of fundamental balance, temperature, nutrients and richness on biomass temporal stability using a linear model. 
balance and richness were modelled as continuous variables, while temperature and nutrients were modelled as categorical variables. balance was log-transformed to meet the assumptions of linear models.




```{r echo=TRUE}
lm_full<-lm(data=complete_aggr,log10(stability)~log10(balance_f)+as.numeric(richness)+nutrients+temperature)

```



Check model's assumptions
```{r model_check1, fig.cap='model check 1.', fig.align="center", fig.height=9, fig.width=12}

check_model(lm_full)
```

```

A linear model was fitted to examine the effects of resource balance, richness, nutrients, and temperature on community stability (measured as log₁₀(stability)). The model explained a significant portion of the variance (Adjusted R² = 0.5115, F(7, 235) = 37.2, p < 2.2e-16).

The intercept of the model was estimated at -0.349 (SE = 0.028, p < 2e-16), indicating the baseline log₁₀(stability) when all predictor variables are at their reference levels.

Among the predictors, log₁₀(balance) showed a significant negative effect on stability (Estimate = -0.054, SE = 0.016, p = 0.0009). This suggests that as balance increases (more balance), stability tends to decrease.


Nutrient concentration also had a significant positive effect on stability, with estimates for 0.35 g/L (Estimate = 0.180, SE = 0.019, p < 2e-16) and 0.75 g/L (Estimate = 0.212, SE = 0.019, p < 2e-16) indicating increased stability with higher nutrient levels.

Finally, temperature regimes showed a significant effect on stability. Both 22–25 °C (Estimate = -0.078, SE = 0.019, p = 3.81e-05) and 25–28 °C (Estimate = -0.098, SE = 0.025, p = 8.44e-05) significantly reduced stability when compared to the baseline (18–21 °C).

Richness did not show a significant effect on stability (Estimate = 0.002, SE = 0.019, p = 0.91), which suggests that it is not richness *per se* that affects stability in this system. Similar results have been previously reported in the literature, e.g. (Petchey et al. 2002)[https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.990203.x?casa_token=THaSxpjziQcAAAAA%3Ay_0gJhnL_rcPsrolHEmZvI0VF14a43WRDTy_UB_kDPQOxq2EA98NQT65Co63J58NCeW-SiTIjoDkgelQ] and (Gonzalez and Descamps-Julien 2004) [https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12925.x?casa_token=4OtlkUcK3YgAAAAA%3ASFjll62wMQW8CBV9qDe5lbGGDXVcRiWna6slN1GaVvTMSRJKDAnpSd_jEBsFKKRsL7muxbJ0Tv3T] who found that species richness did not significantly impact temporal stability in fluctuating environment.

In summary, our findings show that temporal stability is significantly influenced by response diversity (balance), nutrient concentration, and temperature, with higher nutrient concentrations enhancing stability and higher temperatures reducing it. However, species richness was not a significant determinant of stability within the conditions of this study.

# Asynchrony
Response diversity (aka balance) has been suggested as a mechanism that promotes temporal stability of community biomass by promoting species asynchrony.
We thus calculated the asynchrony index suggested by Gross et al. (2014) to calculate the effect of asynchrony on temporal stability and to see how reponse diversity relate to asynchrony.
The index ranges between -1 and 1, with -1 indicating perfect asyncrony and 1 being perfectly synchronous, and 0 indicating random variation.

**Model Fit**

The model fit indices suggest a good fit:

Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.998 and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.986, both indicating a good fit as values close to 1 are considered strong.
Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.047 (with robust RMSEA at 0.051) and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.012. These values indicate a good fit, with RMSEA and SRMR values below 0.05 generally preferred.


Interpretation of Pathways


**Stability**:

*Asynchrony*: Positive and highly significant effect on stability, suggesting that asynchrony (indicating lack of synchrony or compensatory dynamics) is associated with greater stability.

*Temperature*: Negative effect, where higher temperature values correlate with lower stability, potentially due to physiological stress or disruption in community dynamics at higher temperatures.

*Nutrients*: Positive and highly significant, suggesting that greater nutrient availability enhances stability, possibly through support for higher productivity or resource buffering.

*balance*: Negative and significant effect, where greater balance reduces stability.
Richness: Not significant, indicating that within this model, richness does not have a notable effect on stability.


**Asynchrony**:

*balance*: Negative and significant, suggesting that greater balance reduces asynchrony.

*Nutrients*: Negative and highly significant effect, indicating that higher nutrient concentrations are associated with lower asynchrony, possibly due to homogenizing effects of nutrient availability.

*Richness*: Negative and significant, where increased richness is associated with reduced asynchrony, possibly indicating increased interactions or overlap in resource use among species.

**Explained Variance**

*Stability*: The model explains 57% of the variance in stability, suggesting a substantial amount of stability is accounted for by these factors.

*Asynchrony*: The model explains 30.6% of the variance in asynchrony, indicating that while balance, nutrients, and richness contribute, other factors may also play a role in driving asynchrony.

**Summary**

This SEM model demonstrates that stability in the ecosystem is positively associated with asynchrony and nutrient levels, but negatively associated with temperature and balance. Interestingly, species richness has no direct impact on stability but does reduce asynchrony, indicating indirect complexity in the stability-dynamics relationship. This highlights the role of environmental and community factors in ecosystem stability, with asynchrony serving as a crucial intermediary in maintaining stability in fluctuating conditions.

```

Structural equation model (SEM) of the relationship between fundamental balance, asynchrony, richness, nutrients, temperature and temporal stability. The model shows that fundamental balance has a negative effect on asynchrony, which in turn has a positive effect on temporal stability. The model also shows that fundamental balance has a direct negative effect on temporal stability. Temperature has a direct negative effect on temporal stability, while nutrients have a direct positive effect on temporal stability. Richness has a direct negative effect on asynchrony, but no direct effect on temporal stability.
